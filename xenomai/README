Xenomai SPI real-time drivers
====

  This directory contains xenomai 3.0.9 SPI real-time drivers
for beaglebone black (am335x) and raspberry pi zero (bcm2835).

  Note that set_iobufs() used in xenomai-spi-drivers
(spi-bcm2835.c, spi-sun6i.c and spi-omap2-mcspi-rt.c)
allocates for the user ioctl(SPI_RTIOC_SET_IOBUFS)
len = L1_CACHE_ALIGN(len) * 2;
(half for tx and half for rx)
which in case of am335x the resulted len will be greater than
2 multiplied with user requested len. So, ioctl(SPI_RTIOC_TRANSFER)
will transfer more bytes than requested in case of am335x.
Hence, a new ioctl(SPI_RTIOC_TRANSFER_N, int requested_len) was added
to transfer only requested_len bytes to SPI.

  spi-omap2-mcspi-rt.c is am335x (beaglebone black) omap4 spi real-time driver.
Its maximum SPI frequency is 40MHz.

  In order to compile the test, spi.h must be placed in:
$(XENO_INSTALL)/usr/xenomai/include/rtdm/uapi
  In order to compile the drivers, it must be placed in kernel at:
include/xenomai/rtdm/uapi

  For running spitest-laur in bbb or rpi0, first run:
source ./run.sh

  For compiling spitest.c with xenomai, 
copy it in <xenomai_sources>/testsuite/spitest
