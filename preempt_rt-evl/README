preempt_rt-evl
====

Real-time SPI drivers for beaglebone black and raspberry pi zero w
ported from evl to preempt_rt.
Disable spi-omap2-mcspi/spi-bcm2835 and spidev drivers from the kernel menu
and use provided drivers ported from (Xenomai to evl and from) evl to preempt_rt.

After "make ARCH=arm menuconfig" enter in "drivers -> Out-of-band device drivers"
(it is under "SPI support") and select the "Real-time SPI master drivers"
for the board that you work with.
If you can not find it just search for CONFIG_EVL_DRIVERS_SPI_BCM2835
or CONFIG_EVL_DRIVERS_SPI_OMAP2_MCSPI_RT and enable it.
